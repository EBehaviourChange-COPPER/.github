# COPPER - COntextualised and Personalised Physical activity and Exercise Recommendations
## What is COPPER

The Contextualised and Personalised Physical activity and Exercise Recommendations (COPPER) ontology was created in order to support action and coping planning in the context of physical activity promotion by providing personalised recommendations for activities, activity context, barriers and coping strategies.

## Applications of COPPER
It is currently being developed and evaluated within an interdisciplinary project funded by the Special Research Fund by Ghent University. No other projects are currently using the COPPER ontology.

COPPER could be used in digital health projects aiming to provide personalized physical activity recommendations.
